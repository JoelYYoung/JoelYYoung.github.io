# What about Mathematics?

Before diving into the question of *what is computer science*, let's deal with the question of *what is mathematics* first. Obviously it is a big question that no one would ever be confident to answer to. However, I still want to share some of my ideas of *what mathematics is*.

I hold the belief that mathematics is basically an inhesion quality to all human beings, which is an integration of the abilities of abstraction and logical reasoning. And also, there are a set of widely accepted conceptions and mathematical notations, as well as theories on them, which are the *math* we are mostly talking about.

Mathematics comes from our observation of the world, and is an abstraction at a *higher level* than those more concrete abstractions like *apple*.

# What is Computer Science?

Know the history when computer science came into being will provide a helpful point of view to answer this question. When Turing first proposed *Turing Machine*, which is one of the widly accepted methematical models of *computation*, he aimed to answer the [question proposed by *Church*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%27s_thesis_(constructive_mathematics)). Note that the proposal of *turing machine* did not define any new mathematical notions or modify existing theories, but just built a *formal methematical model* using those notions and theories (set theory for example).

Along with its proposal, *turing machine* was proved by its proposer, Alan Turing, to have some limitations. Like being unable to solve Church's problem. And here we have another limitation of *turing machine* that it can not perform real number calculations (approximations are solvable though).

As far as I see, *turing machine* is build as a model of "computers" (human calculator when automated calculaters had not been invented) and many of our *theoretical computer science* researches are of the question of whether a formally defined problem is solvable, or designing a less complex algorithm to solve it. There are also more general questions in *CS* like *can neural network generate intelligence*, and experiments go futher than theoretical proof to such a question.

# CS vs. Mathematics

In a word, I tend to hold that mathematics is more like a religion shared by most poeple, while CS is about observing the world's ***input-output stuffs*** and puting forward to ***mathematical models*** (like TM and *lambda caculus*), and then, reasoning formally or performing experiments on the model (like building a real computer).

Other science subjects are using computer as tools to experiment on their concerned questions. In cog-sci for example, we may perform a computing model after we propose a model of the process of cognition.

# Computer Engeneering

Like engeneering physics, it aims to use our knowledge in CS to create real tools to improve our life.
