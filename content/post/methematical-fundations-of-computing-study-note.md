# Abstract

**Keywords**: Computing Model, Finite Automata (FA or DFA), Undeterministic Finite Automata (UFA), Problem, Decision Problem, Function Problem, Turing Machine (TM), Language, Recognizable Language, Regular Language, Decidable Language

Above are the major topic that will be talked in this artical. And this artical is basically a digest of [Stanford CS103](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs103/cs103.1134/) course slides, which ignores the proof of some conclusion and detailed explainations of some ideas, but just lists the critical conclusions and notions that are helpful for understanding Static Program Analysis.

# Computablility

## How to define the terminology *problem*?

> We want a definition that 
>
> - corresponds to the problems we want to solve, 
> - captures a large class of problems, and 
> - is mathematically simple to reason about. 
>
> No one definition has all three properties.

So we focus on ***Decision Problem***, which is defined to be **problems with yes/no answers**.

## How do we *encode* a *problem*: *language*



# Finite Automata

**Note**: this is correspondent to CS103 Lecture 11-13



## Language of FA: Regular Language



## Undeterministic Finite Automata



# Turing Machines

## Language of TM: Decidability



## How to *encode* a TM?



# Universal Turing Machines



## *Decidability*



# Static Program Analyzer: Universal TM

## *Fail state* of a TM
